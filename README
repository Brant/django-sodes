URLS
---------------

By default, urls for sodes render like this:

^<category>/<chronology>/

For example, it is recommended that the basic category created is "episode". Thus, you'll end up with:
^episode/1/
^episode/2/
^episode/3/

...etc

Any number of these can be put into your settings. Default values will be used if they are not present.

ADMIN PANEL CONFIGURATIONS

TEMPLATES
----------------
There are essentially 3 ways to render a given podcast:

1) short
2) single
3) featured

Calling these rendered sodes is done with the {% render_podcast %} template tag:

{% render_podcast <render_type> <var_in_context> [<extra_context_vars>] %}

render_type:
	short | featured | single
	default: single
	
var_in_context:
	default: episode
	
extra_context_vars:
	automatically grabs: MEDIA_URL, request
	
templates:
	"sodes/renders/(single|short|featured).html"
